Using data from The Public Science Lab at NC State ([source](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)), this dashboard catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
